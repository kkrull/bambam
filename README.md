# Bam Bam

Converts a MIDI drum track from one drum sample map to another.

## Development

Start in the middle (domain model) and test outwards (UI), via a different
driver. Push scenarios down to unit tests and extract libraries for stable
parts.

Prefer over-simplification over using terminology from the solution domain.

### Test code

```shell
npm test
```

## Tools

There are a lot of tools that are used for development. Here are the packages
that provide them and where to look for configuration:

- Cucumber runs BDD tests with Gherkin syntax.
  - `@cucumber/*` provides cucumber and formatters, which make the output on
    the command line look nice.
  - `ts-node` adds TypeScript support to `cucumber-js`.
  - `tsconfig-paths` allows TypeScript sources in `features/` to use path
    aliases to production code sources.
- `direnv` integrates environment management with your shell (e.g. bash or zsh).
  - `.envrc`: configuration script
  - Homebrew installation: `brew install direnv`
    - Note: Follow instructions about updating `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`
- EditorConfig defines basic parameters for formatting source files.
  - `.editorconfig`: configuration file
- ESLint performs static analysis and style checks.
  - `eslint`: main package
  - `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` add
    support for TypeScript.
  - `.eslintrc.cjs`: configuration file
- GitHub actions perform Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
  - `.github/workflows`: Workflow definitions
- Husky adds a Git pre-commit hook that runs checks on staged files, before
  committing to the repository.
  - `husky`: main package
  - `.husky/pre-commit`: The actual pre-commit script
  - `package.json` also has a `prepare` script that installs the Git hook.
- `lint-staged` runs the actual checks on source files staged for the next Git
  commit.
  - `lint-staged`: main package
  - `.lintstagedrc.cjs`: configuration file
- Node.js is the runtime platform.
  - `package.json`: package properties, dependencies, and task automation (e.g.
    scripts)
- Node Version Manager (`nvm`) installs a known version of Node.js and
  configures your shell to use it.
  - `.nvmrc`: configuration file
- Prettier formats source files.
  - `prettier`: main package
  - `.prettierignore`: which files should be skipped, while formatting
  - `.prettierrc.json`: configuration file
- TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript.
  - `typescript`: main package
  - `@tsconfig/node18`: base configuration for the version of node.js we're
    using here
  - `@types/*`: type definitions for all the other packages we're using
  - `tsconfig.json` - configuration file for sources in `src/`
  - `features/tsconfig.json` - configuration file for sources in `features/`

## Reference

### General MIDI Percussion key map

> For MIDI Channel 10, each MIDI KEY number ("NOTE#") corresponds to a
> different drum sound, as shown below. While many current instruments
> also have additional sounds above or below the range show here, and
> may even have additional "kits" with variations of these sounds, only
> these sounds are supported by General MIDI Level 1 devices.

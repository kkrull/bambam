# Bam Bam

Converts a MIDI drum track from one drum sample map to another.

## Architecture decisions

- Establish development tools: CI/CD, formatting, linting, spell checks, test
  automation, and type checking.
  - Integrate with Git, so code is always formatted and checked for linting errors.
  - Write basic documentation for developers, to trace tools to their
    configuration and documentation.
- Use the following criteria to decide where to put code:
  - Goal: Use reasonable but fairly objective criteria to maintain flow.
    Example: using pure functions avoids the need to decide which class gets a
    new method and makes unit testing pretty simple.
  - Any data crossing a boundary: Make a `class`. Avoid naked primitives.
  - Simple data queries: Make these methods on the class containing the data.
  - Functions that do stuff: Make pure `functions`. Group pure functions that
    operate on the same type into a file named after that type (example:
    `midi-chunk-fns.ts`).

## Development

### Format code

```shell
npm run format #Re-format files in place
npm run format:check #CI-ready script that checks for improperly formatted files
```

### Install packages

```shell
npm install
npm ci #Make sure only the declared packages are installed (good for CI)
```

### Lint code

```shell
npm run lint #CI-ready script that checks for linting errors
npm run lint:fix #Automatically fix linting errors, where possible
```

### Run scripts

There's a utility script in `src/main/` that helps inspect MIDI files.

```shell
#List chunks
npm run main:list-chunks features/data/ezd-mapping.mid

#List events
npm run main:list-events features/support/midi-source/mapping/modern-original-mix-type-1.mid
npm run --silent main:list-events features/support/midi-source/mapping/modern-original-mix-type-1.mid | jq
npm run --silent main:list-events features/support/midi-source/mapping/modern-original-mix-type-1.mid \
  | jq '.tracks[1].events[] | { channel: .channel, deltaTime: .deltaTime, note: .note, type: .eventType, subType: .subType, velocity: .velocity }'
```

### Test code

```shell
npm run test #Run all Cucumber scenarios
npm run test:focus #Run scenarios tagged with @focus
npm run test -- [...cucumber.js args] #Pass custom options to cucumber.js
```

Cucumber scenarios can be tagged as follows, to change where data is sourced:

- `@FileMidiSource`: Read MIDI data from an actual file
- `@StaticMidiSource`: Build MIDI data inside the test

See `MidiSourceHooks.ts` for details.

### Type-check code

```shell
npm run types:check #CI-ready script that checks for type safety issues
npm run types:watch #Watch known source files, reporting any type issues live
```

## Development strategy

Start in the middle (domain model) and test outwards, via a different driver.
Push scenarios down to unit tests and extract libraries for stable parts.

Prefer over-simplification over using terminology from the solution domain.

## Future work

- Include Marker events?
  - It doesn't define timing or notes, but it does describe structure and form.
  - That might be useful when transferring a MIDI percussion track, to a
    MuseScore file, for the first time.
  - Updates to a MuseScore file that already have a percussion track won't
    benefit from that information.
- Include Key Signature?
  - It may not be very relevant on a percussion track.

## Source code structure

- `features/`: Feature and discovery tests, along with code specific to those.
- `main/`: Top-level scripts to call from `package.json`.
- `midi/`: Abstract data model and core logic.

```

## Tools

These tools are used for the project. Look here for references to documentation
and key configuration files.

### Code Spell Checker

    [cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/tree/main/docs) and
    formatters, which make the output on the command line look nice.
  - `ts-node` adds TypeScript support to `cucumber-js`.
  - `tsconfig-paths` allows TypeScript sources in `features/` to use path
    aliases to production code sources.

## Reference

### General MIDI Percussion key map

> For MIDI Channel 10, each MIDI KEY number ("NOTE#") corresponds to a
> different drum sound, as shown below. While many current instruments
> also have additional sounds above or below the range show here, and
> may even have additional "kits" with variations of these sounds, only
> these sounds are supported by General MIDI Level 1 devices.

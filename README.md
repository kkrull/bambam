# Bam Bam

Converts a MIDI drum track from one drum sample map to another.

## Development

### Format code

```shell
npm run format #Re-format files in place
npm run format:check #CI-ready script that checks for improperly formatted files
```

### Install packages

```shell
npm install
npm ci #Make sure only the declared packages are installed (good for CI)
```

### Lint code

```shell
npm run lint #CI-ready script that checks for linting errors
npm run lint:fix #Automatically fix linting errors, where possible
```

### Run scripts

There's a utility script in `src/main/` that helps inspect MIDI files.

```shell
#Usage
npm run main:list-chunks <MIDI file>

#Examples
npm run main:list-chunks features/data/ezd-mapping.mid
npm run main:list-events features/support/midi-source/mapping/modern-original-mix-type-1.mid
npm run --silent main:list-events features/support/midi-source/mapping/modern-original-mix-type-1.mid | jq
```

### Test code

```shell
npm run test #Run all Cucumber scenarios
npm run test:focus #Run scenarios tagged with @focus
npm run test -- [...cucumber.js args] #Pass custom options to cucumber.js
```

Cucumber scenarios can be tagged as follows, to change where data is sourced:

- `@FileMidiSource`: Read MIDI data from an actual file
- `@StaticMidiSource`: Build MIDI data inside the test

See `MidiSourceHooks.ts` for details.

### Type-check code

```shell
npm run types:check #CI-ready script that checks for type safety issues
npm run types:watch #Watch known source files, reporting any type issues live
```

## Development strategy

Start in the middle (domain model) and test outwards, via a different driver.
Push scenarios down to unit tests and extract libraries for stable parts.

Prefer over-simplification over using terminology from the solution domain.

## Future work

- Include Marker events?
  - It doesn't define timing or notes, but it does describe structure and form.
  - That might be useful when transferring a MIDI percussion track, to a
    MuseScore file, for the first time.
  - Updates to a MuseScore file that already have a percussion track won't
    benefit from that information.
- Include Key Signature?
  - It may not be very relevant on a percussion track.

## Tools

There are a lot of tools that are used for development. Here are the packages
that provide them and where to look for configuration:

- Code Spell Checker:
  - `cspell.json`: configuration file and dictionary
  - Documentation: <https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker>
  - VS Code extension: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker>
- Cucumber runs BDD tests with Gherkin syntax.
  - `@cucumber/*` provides cucumber and formatters, which make the output on
    the command line look nice.
  - `ts-node` adds TypeScript support to `cucumber-js`.
  - `tsconfig-paths` allows TypeScript sources in `features/` to use path
    aliases to production code sources.
  - `features/cucumber.cjs`: configuration file for where to find tests and
    support code
  - `features/tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
  - VS Code Extension: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CucumberOpen.cucumber-official>
- `direnv` integrates environment management with your shell (e.g. bash or zsh).
  - `.envrc`: configuration script
  - Homebrew installation: `brew install direnv`
    - Note: Follow instructions about updating `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`

  - `.editorconfig`: configuration file
- ESLint performs static analysis and style checks.
  - `eslint`: main package
  - `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` add
    support for TypeScript.

  - `.github/workflows`: Workflow definitions
- Husky adds a Git pre-commit hook that runs checks on staged files, before
  committing to the repository.
  - `husky`: main package
  - `.husky/pre-commit`: The actual pre-commit script
  - `package.json` also has a `prepare` script that installs the Git hook.
- `lint-staged` runs the actual checks on source files staged for the next Git
  commit.
  - `lint-staged`: main package
  - `.lintstagedrc.cjs`: configuration file
- Markdownlint
  - `.markdownlint.json`: configuration file
  - Documentation: <https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint>
  - Documentation (rules): <https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md>
  - Usage: `markdownlint-cli2 .markdownlint.json <markdown file> [...markdown files]`
  - VS Code extension: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint>
- Node.js is the runtime platform.
  - `package.json`: package properties, dependencies, and task automation (e.g.
    scripts)
- Node Version Manager (`nvm`) installs a known version of Node.js and
  configures your shell to use it.
  - `.nvmrc`: configuration file
- Prettier formats source files.
  - `prettier`: main package
  - `.prettierignore`: which files should be skipped, while formatting
  - `.prettierrc.json`: configuration file
  - Documentation (options): <https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html>

  - `@tsconfig/node18`: base configuration for the version of node.js we're
    using here
  - `@types/*`: type definitions for all the other packages we're using
  - `tsconfig.json` - configuration file for sources in `src/`
  - `features/tsconfig.json` - configuration file for sources in `features/`

## Reference

### General MIDI Percussion key map

> For MIDI Channel 10, each MIDI KEY number ("NOTE#") corresponds to a
> different drum sound, as shown below. While many current instruments
> also have additional sounds above or below the range show here, and
> may even have additional "kits" with variations of these sounds, only
> these sounds are supported by General MIDI Level 1 devices.

Feature: Convert EZDrummer 2 track to General MIDI
  As a musician
  I want to convert EZDrummer 2 tracks to General MIDI
  So that I can maintain flow when copying drum tracks to MuseScore

  Scenario: BamBam should make a MIDI track that can be read by the same device
    Given I have exported an EZDrummer 2 track from my DAW, as MIDI
    When I ask BamBam to remap that track to General MIDI Percussion

    Then the re-mapped track should be a valid MIDI track
    And the re-mapped track should have the same time resolution as the original
    # And the re-mapped track should have the same format as the original

  Scenario: BamBam should copy all non-mappable events from the original track
    Given I have exported an EZDrummer 2 track from my DAW, as MIDI
    When I ask BamBam to remap that track to General MIDI Percussion
    Then the re-mapped track should have all non-note events from the original

  Scenario: BamBam should re-map an EZDrummer 2 track to General MIDI Percussion
    Given I have exported an EZDrummer 2 track from my DAW, as MIDI
    When I ask BamBam to remap that track to General MIDI Percussion

    Then the re-mapped track should have re-mapped notes
    And re-mapped notes should be on the same MIDI channel as the source notes
    And re-mapped notes should exist in the General MIDI Percussion map
